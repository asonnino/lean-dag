# Checkpoints over Barnacle and segmented runs, on data

`commitFinalized_barnacle` applied to two concrete runs of Mysticeti on
four validators, one per boundary.

* **Barnacle** (`Boundary.atAnchor`): `run2` and `run2'` on `Usun`
  (`LeanDagTest/Barnacle/Agreement.lean`), under the AIMD rule.
  Validator `2` holds the view `Vsun'` without block `31`, and the
  others hold the full view `Vsun`. Slot `5`, the anchor of
  configuration `0`, commits block `21` and is finalized.
* **Adaptive** (`Boundary.atThreshold`): `segRun` on `Usk`
  (`LeanDagTest/Adaptive/Asynchronous.lean`), under the constant rule.
  Slot `3` commits block `15`. Configuration `2` outputs it, and
  configuration `0` decides it above its own boundary without
  outputting it. The bridge finalizes the same checkpoint from either
  configuration.

The fault model has three reliable, available signers `0`, `1`, `2` at
quorum `3`. Validator `3` is Byzantine and proposes a forked checkpoint,
which has no certificate. The VM maps slot `κ` and block `L` to height
`κ + 1`, with the history listing the block of every slot below `κ`
followed by `L`. Agreement makes that history the same on every view.
