# Declaration dependency extraction

Walks the compiled environment and emits, for every `LeanDag`/`LeanDagTest`
declaration, the constants it mentions — in its type *and* in its proof
term. Run with

    lake env lean scripts/DepGraph.lean > docs/depgraph/deps.tsv

Output is tab-separated, two record kinds:

    NODE <name> <module> <kind>
    EDGE <name> <dependency>

`kind` is `thm` for proofs, `def` for definitions, `ind` for inductives
and structures, `ax` for axioms. Only edges between kept declarations are
emitted; Mathlib and core dependencies are dropped, since the question is
which results of *this* development support which others.

/-- A declaration's user-facing name. Private declarations are stored under
a mangled `_private.<Module>.<idx>.` prefix, so testing the raw name against
`LeanDag` rejects every one of them. Everything else is its own name. -/
def userName (n : Name) : Name := privateToUserName n

/-- Keep every declaration of this development, **including** private and
compiler-generated ones: a proof of one labelled result frequently reaches
another only through a private auxiliary or a `.proof_N`, and dropping those
would silently sever the path. Mathlib and core constants are excluded, and
safely so — they never mention a `LeanDag` constant, so no path between two
of our results can run through them.

The test is on the *user* name. Testing the stored name instead dropped
every private declaration — 53 of them — which is exactly the severing
this comment warns against, and it went unnoticed because the graph then
reports a shorter path rather than an error. -/
