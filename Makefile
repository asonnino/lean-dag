# Development loop for lean-dag.  Timings below are wall clock on a warm
# cache, measured on a 14-core machine; they are why the targets are split
# the way they are.
#
#   make fast     library only, plus the sub-second checks          ~3s warm
#   make check    both libraries, plus the sub-second checks        ~5s warm
#   make deps     regenerate deps.tsv and the support diagrams       ~26s
#   make pdf      the report PDF                                     ~2s
#   make verify   everything, in the order a commit needs it        ~30s
#
# `make fast` skips the witness layer (LeanDagTest) and the dependency
# extraction.  A cold `make fast` is 119s against 325s for a cold `make
# check`, because the witnesses are `decide` over concrete models and cost
# about 11s each.  Run `make check` before committing: the witnesses are a
# default lake target on purpose, so that a definition change which empties
# the concrete structures fails the build instead of silently trivialising
# every theorem above it.
#
# `make deps` is separate because `scripts/DepGraph.lean` walks the whole
# compiled environment and takes 25s, five to eight times an incremental
# build.  Nothing it produces changes unless a declaration is added,
# renamed or removed, so it does not belong in the loop.  Run it when the
# set of declarations changes, and before a commit that adds any.
